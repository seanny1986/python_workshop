There are many instances where creating an object-based structure is advantageous; for example, imagine that we want to simulate an aircraft. An aircraft has many different components, such as wings, empennage, and engines, each of which is also an object. Breaking the aircraft up into a hierarchy of objects means that we can dramatically increase the flexibility of our code whilst improving readability and maintainability. For example, we can define an engine object to create many different types of aircraft engine, and then try running our simulation with each different engine. Similarly, we can specify different wings with different aerodynamic characteristics, and simulate how the aircraft would fly. \n",
